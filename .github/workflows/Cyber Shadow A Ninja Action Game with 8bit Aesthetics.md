If you are looking for some tips and tricks to improve your gameplay in Cyber Shadow, here are some useful suggestions that you can try:
 
- Be patient. The game is not meant to be rushed through, but rather enjoyed at your own pace. Take your time to observe the enemies, traps, and environments, and plan your moves accordingly. Don't be afraid to retry a section if you fail, as you will learn from your mistakes and get better.
- Lean on your abilities by buying SP regen. SP is the resource that allows you to use your special skills and items, such as fireballs, shurikens, and dashes. You can replenish your SP by collecting essence from enemies or by using Service Pods. However, you can also buy an upgrade that will make your SP regenerate over time, which can be very helpful in tough situations.
- The dash slash is your new best friend. One of the skills that you will unlock early on is the dash slash, which lets you perform a quick horizontal slash while moving. This skill is very useful for both offense and defense, as it can damage enemies, deflect projectiles, and cover distance. You can also use it in mid-air to extend your jump or change direction.
- You don't need SP to use regular versions of skills. While some skills and items require SP to activate, such as the fireball or the shuriken, others can be used without SP as long as you have the corresponding item equipped. For example, you can use the charge slash without SP if you have the Swag Blade item, or you can use the parry without SP if you have the Parry Shield item. These regular versions of skills are weaker than their SP versions, but they can still be handy in certain situations.
- Backtrack for powerups. As mentioned before, you can revisit previous levels to find secrets and powerups that you may have missed or couldn't access before. These powerups include HP and SP upgrades, essence containers, and extra lives. They can make a big difference in your survivability and performance, so don't hesitate to explore every corner of Mekacity.

Cyber Shadow is a game that will challenge your skills and reflexes, but also reward your persistence and curiosity. It is a game that pays tribute to the classics of the 8-bit era, but also adds its own twists and innovations. If you are a fan of ninja action games and retro-style graphics, you should definitely give Cyber Shadow a try.
