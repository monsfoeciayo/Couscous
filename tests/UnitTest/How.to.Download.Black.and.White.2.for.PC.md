## Black and White 2: A Mixed Bag of Godly Powers
 
Black and White 2 is a game that tries to do many things at once, but does not excel at any of them. It is a sequel to the original Black and White, which was a groundbreaking and innovative game that combined elements of strategy, simulation, and god game genres. However, the sequel fails to live up to the expectations set by its predecessor, and instead offers a more streamlined and simplified experience that lacks depth and challenge.
 
The game's main selling point is the ability to play as a god who can shape the world according to your alignment. You can choose to be good, evil or somewhere in between, and influence the behavior of your followers and the outcome of the war. You can also interact with your giant creature, a sort of virtual pet that can also serve as your enforcer. The game gives you a lot of freedom and options to play as you wish, but also suffers from a lack of focus and direction. The game's story is more coherent than the first game, but still lacks any real emotional impact or motivation. The game's missions are repetitive and linear, and often boil down to either building a city or destroying an enemy one.
 
The game's graphics and sound are impressive, and create a rich and immersive world that is full of life and detail. The game's landscapes are stunning, the towns and cities are vibrant, and the armies are spectacular. The game also features realistic effects such as depth of field, weather systems, and fuzzy fur on your creatures. The game's sound is also well done, with a dynamic soundtrack that changes according to your alignment and actions, as well as voice acting that adds humor and personality to your advisers.
 
However, the game's gameplay is where it falls short. The game's strategy elements are surprisingly basic, and do not offer much challenge or variety. The game's combat is simplistic and tedious, and often comes down to who has more troops or miracles. The game's city-building is also limited and restrictive, and does not allow much creativity or customization. The game's creature-training has arguably been watered down from the first game, and does not offer much feedback or reward for your efforts. The game's AI is also non-existent and highly scripted, and does not react to your actions or strategies.
 
Black and White 2 is a game that has a lot of potential, but fails to deliver on it. It is a game that tries to be everything for everyone, but ends up being nothing for anyone. It is a game that looks great, but plays poorly. It is a game that offers freedom, but lacks direction. It is a game that could have been great, but is instead mediocre.
